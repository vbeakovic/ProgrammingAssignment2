## Functions for matrices caching
## By taking advantage of R's lexical scoping rules matrices that may require
## long or repeated computations are stored in a cached variable(list), allowing 
## for quick retrieval and computing only when changes occur.


## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
